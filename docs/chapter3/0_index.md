# Lab 2: Conducting AI Analysis at Scale

This lab walks through how to configure and use the *Custom Machine Learning Models* feature in **IBM OpenPages 9.x** to conduct 5W analysis of control descriptions and how to do this in an automated workflow.

You will:

1. Set up an OpenPages object and view for AI analysis
2. Conduct complex AI analysis and set fields
3. Develop an automated workflow to conduct the AI analysis at scale

> **Prerequisites & Notes**  
> - You must have **Custom Machine Learning Models** permission in OpenPages, otherwise the menu is not visible.
> - You must have watsonx.ai
