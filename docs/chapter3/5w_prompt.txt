2. Provide a Control Quality: High if 5W are present, Good if 4W are present, Average if 3W are present, Low if 2W are present, Very Low if 1 or 0 W are present. the Quality should be a Key in the Json answer.
4. Provide a Control Quality Explain: A brief explanation of the reason you believe the control description is in the quality you determined.
