# Lab 1: Integrating a Custom ML Model for Risk Classification in OpenPages

This lab walks through how to configure and use the *Custom Machine Learning Models* feature in **IBM OpenPages 9.x** to automatically classify risk descriptions into your two‑level taxonomy.

You will:

1. Set up and deploy the prompt in Prompt Lab
2. Configure a connection to your deployed model 
2. Map input fields  
3. Map output fields and JSONata expressions  
4. Configure user guidance  
5. Add the model to a view  
6. Test the integration  

> **Prerequisites & Notes**  
> - You must have **Custom Machine Learning Models** permission in OpenPages, otherwise the menu is not visible.
> - You must have watsonx.ai
