# Lab 3: Creating Custom Input Sources for AI Analysis

This lab walks through how to configure and use the *Custom Machine Learning Models* feature in **IBM OpenPages 9.x** to create custom views for more complex AI analysis that draws on data from multiple objects.

You will:

1. Set up a custom input view in OpenPages for AI analysis
2. Validate the input data using logs
3. Develop and deploy the prompt to conduct analysis 
4. Integrate the deployed ML model into a view that a user can trigger the AI analysis with

> **Prerequisites & Notes**  
> - You must have **Custom Machine Learning Models** permission in OpenPages, otherwise the menu is not visible.
> - You must have watsonx.ai
