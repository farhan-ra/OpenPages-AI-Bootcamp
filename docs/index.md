# **OpenPages AI Bootcamp**

Welcome to the **OpenPages AI Bootcamp**, a hands-on learning experience designed to help you harness the power of **IBM watsonx.ai** and **OpenPages 9.x** to automate risk management, control analysis, and data-driven decision-making.  

This bootcamp combines guided tutorials, real-world use cases, and lab exercises to teach you how to configure and integrate **Custom Machine Learning Models** directly into OpenPages workflows and views — transforming manual processes into intelligent, scalable AI solutions.

## **Bootcamp Overview**

### **Chapter 1: Prompt Engineering & AI Foundations**

**Goal:**  
- Understand prompt engineering basics  
- Run a simple prompt in the watsonx.ai UI  

You’ll explore the fundamentals of prompt design and learn how to craft effective AI instructions within watsonx.ai. This sets the foundation for deploying your own AI-powered solutions in OpenPages.

### **Chapter 2: Lab 1 — Classifying Risks with AI**

In this lab, you’ll learn how to configure and use the **Custom Machine Learning Models** feature in OpenPages to automatically classify risk descriptions into a two-level taxonomy.  

**You will:**  
1. Set up and deploy the prompt in Prompt Lab  
2. Configure a connection to your deployed model  
3. Map input fields  
4. Map output fields and JSONata expressions  
5. Configure user guidance  
6. Add the model to a view  
7. Test the integration  

By the end of this lab, your OpenPages environment will be able to automatically categorize risks with AI-driven precision.

### **Chapter 3: Lab 2 — Conducting AI Analysis at Scale**

This lab shows how to conduct advanced AI-driven analysis — the **5W analysis** (Who, What, When, Where, Why) — on control descriptions, and how to scale this process across large datasets through automation.  

**You will:**  
1. Set up an OpenPages object and view for AI analysis  
2. Conduct complex AI analysis and update relevant fields  
3. Develop an automated workflow to run the analysis at scale  

You’ll learn how to build a seamless workflow that enables continuous, intelligent analysis across your OpenPages environment.  

---

### **Chapter 4: Lab 3 — Creating Custom Input Sources for AI Analysis**

In this advanced lab, you’ll create **custom views** that pull together data from multiple OpenPages objects to enable richer, more contextual AI analysis.  

**You will:**  
1. Set up a custom input view in OpenPages for AI analysis  
2. Validate the input data using logs  
3. Develop and deploy the prompt for analysis  
4. Integrate the deployed ML model into a user-accessible view  

This lab helps you design flexible, powerful input sources that expand the reach and sophistication of your AI insights.

## **Who This Bootcamp Is For**

This bootcamp is ideal for:  
- Risk and compliance professionals exploring AI integration  
- OpenPages administrators and developers  
- Data scientists and analysts building AI models in watsonx.ai  
- Anyone looking to automate and scale GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) processes with AI  

---

## **By the End of the Bootcamp**

You’ll have the knowledge and tools to:  
- Integrate watsonx.ai models directly into OpenPages  
- Automate risk and control analysis workflows  
- Build custom input and output configurations for AI models  
- Create scalable, intelligent solutions within your existing OpenPages environment
